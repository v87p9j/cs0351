ELEC 9732 Assignment 3
Q1 (25) Input-Output NCF.
Consider the system
˙x1 = −αx1 − βx2u + γ
˙x2 = −ax2 + bx1u
y = x2
which describes a field-controlled DC motor.
x1 is the armature current; x2 is the speed; u is the field current taken to be the control input.
The parameters are positive constants.
(i) Calculate the relative degree of the system.
(ii) Find a non-linearity cancelling feedback control law.
(iii) Find the internal or zero dynamics and investi-gate its stabilit代 写ELEC 9732 Assignment 3Haskell
代做程序编程语言y. To do this take v(t) = −gy(t).
Show that stable zero dynamics is possible with 0 < g < a.
Then show that |x1(t)| is bounded and in partic-ular that |x1(t)| ≤ max(|x1(0)|, α/γ).
Q2 (25) State NCF.
Consider the system
˙x1 = −x1 + x2
˙x2 = x1 − x1x3 − x2 + u
˙x3 = x1 − x1x2 + 2x3
(i) Show the system allows NCF.
(ii) Find the most general form. of h(x).
(iii) Design a nonlinearity cancelling feedback control law.
